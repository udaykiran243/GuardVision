# GuardVision: Privacy Intelligence for Everyone


[![Status: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Beta-blue)]()
[![Compliance: HIPAA-Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Compliance-HIPAA%20Ready-green)]()

**GuardVision** is a next-generation privacy protection system that automatically detects and redacts sensitive personal (PII) and medical (PHI) information from images.

We operate on a **Dual-Mode Architecture** designed to serve both individual users needing quick privacy tools and large healthcare enterprises requiring strict compliance.

---

## 🚀 Two Modes, One Mission

### 1. Individual Mode (Powered by Gemini Flash)
*For researchers, developers, and everyday users.*
- **Instant Privacy**: Drop an image, get a redacted version in seconds.
- **AI-Driven Accuracy**: Uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to visually recognize complex PII like faces, signatures, and credit cards without traditional OCR limitations.
- **Zero Setup**: Runs entirely in the browser/client-side with a lightweight API call.

### 2. Enterprise Mode (Hospital-Grade Architecture)
*For hospitals, insurance firms, and regulated industries.*
- **Bulk Processing Pipeline**: A robust backend architecture designed to handle thousands of patient records or DICOM files simultaneously.
- **Deterministic Compliance**: Combines AI with **Microsoft Presidio** and strict rule-based redaction to ensure 0% data leakage transparency.
- **Full Auditability**: Every single redaction is logged, time-stamped, and verifiable for HIPAA/GDPR audits.

---

## 🏗️ Enterprise Architecture

The Enterprise Mode is built on a scalable, asynchronous pipeline designed for high-throughput environments like PACS servers or data lakes.

    E --> F[Privacy Artifacts - MinIO]
    E --> G[Compliance Logs - Postgres]
    end
    
    F --> H[Secure Export]
    G --> H
```

### Technical Stack (Enterprise)
- **Ingestion**: **FastAPI** for high-performance, async request handling.
- **Queue**: **Redis** to decouple upload from processing, preventing system overloads.
- **Workers**: **Celery** distributed workers for parallel processing of massive datasets.
- **Storage**: **MinIO** (S3-compatible) for secure, on-premise object storage.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for immutable audit trails of every redacted entity.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.9+ (for Enterprise backend)
- Redis & PostgreSQL (for local Enterprise testing)

### Quick Start (Individual Mode)
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SowmyaLR/GuardVision.git
    cd GuardVision
    ```

2.  **Install & Run:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Configure API:**
    Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local`:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
    ```

### Database Setup & Migration (Enterprise Backend)

1.  **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and set your `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/guardvision`).

2.  **Initialize Database**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Run migrations
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
    alembic upgrade head
    
    # Seed data
    python scripts/create_sample_job.py
    ```

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Path to Zero-Trust
We are actively building out the Enterprise features to move from cloud-dependent AI to fully offline, zero-trust processing.
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Deterministic local processing (removing external LLM dependencies for sensitive data).
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Direct PACS integration for seamless hospital workflows.
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Federated learning support for improving detection models without moving data.
